### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>


![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes that further need to be aware of the current time (i.e. `AddCommandParser` & `EditCommandParser`) further inherit from the `ClockDependentParser` interface.
* Any command that needs to be aware of the current time takes the current time during parsing. (I.e. `add` & `edit`)

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `connexion.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature (implemented by Kwok Yong)
The user can filter contacts based on a specified field and keywords.

Each field has its own predicate, `{Field}ContainsKeywordsPredicate` or `{Is/Not}MarkedPredicate`. 
For example, `JobContainsKeywordsPredicate` represents the predicate for Job. 
Through `FilterCommandParser`, a field prefix is detected to recognize the field to filter for. Then, depending
on the field, the parser will determine whether to parse keywords as a list. Then, the parser will construct the corresponding predicate, 
which in turn is used to construct a `FilterCommand`.

Through `FilterCommand#execute()`, the predicate is then passed as an argument to `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`, causing the UI to only show contacts who satisfy the predicate.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between Logic and Model components after the API call `execute("filter c/Google")`

![Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `filter c/Google` Command](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

The reason behind implementing the feature this way is that this feature is partly inspired
by the prior implementation of the find feature in AB3. This is just an enhancement of the feature, in which the target
user is more likely to find filtering contacts via a specified field, especially company and job, useful.

### LastModified (implemented by Xavier)
Each `Person` has a last modified detailing when it was last modified.

This necessitates the implementation of an internal `Clock` object in the `Model` and `Logic` classes.

The `Model` has a `Clock` object (as described in the [Java time API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Clock.html)), which is set to
the current system time on instantiation. The methods `setClock` and `getClock` are exposed to modify the clock used, for testing or for extension.

The `Logic` object reads the `Model`'s clock to reference what clock operations should use, and instantiates a version of `AddressBookParser` that uses that clock via chained method `withClock`.
The new `AddressBookParser` then further passes the clock via method chaining to any `ClockDependentParser`s, or ignores the clock for commands that do not need to care about the clock.

Currently, the only `ClockDependentParser`s are `AddCommandParser`,`EditCommandParser`,`ScheduleParser` and `NoteParser`.

Finally, the relevant parsers read the clock via `LocalDateTime.now(clock)` to extract the correct `LocalDateTime` object as needed.

The above is summarised in the activity diagram below :
![LastModifiedDateTimeActivityDiagram.png](images%2FLastModifiedDateTimeActivityDiagram.png)

This `LocalDateTime` is passed into the `LastModifiedDateTime` constructor for further use as a field in relevant objects.
Furthermore, `LastModifiedDateTime` truncates the `LocalDateTime` to precision of seconds.

Of note, this means that :
* `LastModifiedDateTime` will have its notion of "current" time set to some time during parsing
* It is possible to inject `Clock` objects for testing/extension into the following objects : `Logic`, `Model`, all `ClockDependentParsers` (including `AddressBookParser`)
* `LastModifiedDateTime`s that vary by milliseconds will evaluate to be the same object

##### Summary of recommendations for future extension of commands that should modify the last-modified :
* The command should implement `ClockDependentParser`
* An instance of your parser class generated by `withClock` should be used to ensure proper clock synchronisation between your parser class and the parent `Logic` class
* Your class should have a `Clock` object internally, and instantiate a `LastModifiedDateTime` using that `Clock` somehow.


### Schedule feature (implemented by Geoff)
The user can schedule meetings with contacts.

Through `ScheduleCommandParser`, the index of the person in the list and the field prefixes `i/` and `a/` (if there is) are read. Keywords are then parsed and read into a `ScheduleDescripter`
object, where it is used construct a `ScheduleCommand` object.

Through `ScheduleCommand#execute()`, the `scheduleDescriptor` is then used to create a `Person` object with the added or edited schedule and schedule name.
Through `model#setPerson()`, the `Person` object created then replaces the original `Person` object in the list.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between Logic and Model components after the API call `execute("schedule 1 i/2023-12-27-07-00 a/Seminar")`
![Interactions Between Logic and Model Components for the `schedule 1 i/2023-12-27-07-00 a/Seminar` Command](images/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

The reason behind implementing this feature this way is partly inspired by the prior implementation of edit feature in AB3.
By using ScheduleDescriptor object, we are able to keep the same level of abstraction.

An alternative is to create a ClearSchedule feature that clears the schedule and scheduleName, as the schedule feature can only
write and override, but not remove.

### Clearing of schedule (implemented by Xavier)
The sister command to the above command, this allows clearing of schedules.
The implementation is similar, but stripped down in some places.

Through `ClearScheduleCommandParser`, the index of the person in the list is read.

Through `ClearScheduleCommand#execute()`, the `ClearScheduleDescriptor` is then used to create a `Person` object that is identical to the referenced `Person`, except
**not having any schedule date or name**.

Through `model#setPerson()`, the `Person` object created then replaces the original `Person` object in the list.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between Logic and Model components after the API call `execute("clearschedule 1")`
![Interactions Between Logic and Model Components for the `clearschedule 1` Command](images%2FClearScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)![Interactions Between Logic and Model Components for the `schedule 1 i/2023-12-27-07-00 a/Seminar` Command](images/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

The reasoning behind this implementation mirrors the reasoning for the above schedule implementation, in wanting to continue the precedent set by the edit feature, and maintaining abstraction.

The reason the `ScheduleDescriptor` class is not re-used is to similarly attempt to reduce coupling, as `ScheduleDescriptor` is fairly tightly coupled to `Schedule` by necessity.

### Mark Feature (implemented by Angel)
The user can mark contacts of interest through the Mark Command respectively.

The `Mark` attribute has been added to the `Person` Model, and the boolean value of `markStatus` in the `Mark` Class is set to true via the method `mark()`.

When the `MarkCommand` is executed, `markPerson()` is called to the model object with the person chosen by index from the displayed person list.

When a new `person` is created via the `AddCommand`, the markStatus is set to false by default.

If a contact has been marked, the UI will display "â˜…" as the string representation for the `Mark` attribute, otherwise, it represents the attribute as "â˜†".

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark operation works:
![MarkSequenceDiagram](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)

### Unmark Feature (implemented by Angel)
The user can un-mark contacts of interest through the UnMark Command.

The `Mark` attribute has been added to the `Person` Model, and the boolean value of `markStatus` in the `Mark` Class is set to false via the method `unmark()`.

When a new `person` is created via the `AddCommand`, the markStatus is set to false by default.

If a contact has been un-marked, the UI will display "â˜†" as the string representation for the `Mark` attribute.

The following sequence diagram shows how the un-mark operation works:
![UnMarkSequenceDiagram](images/UnMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

### Detail Feature (implemented by Angel & Kwok Yong)
The user can view the details of their contact by updating the PersonViewPanel().

Details include name, tags, phone number, email, company, job, lastModified, scheduled meetings, and notes.

Based on the index input from the user in the `DetailCommand`, the `Person` object at that index is retrieved.  The `detailedPerson` in `AddressBook` is set via the `setDetailedPerson(Person p)` in `Model`.

This Person object is updated and fed to the PersonViewPanel after `executeCommand(String commandText)` is executed. Displays "To view a person's detail, type 'detail INDEX'" if `Person` object is null.

The following sequence diagram shows how the detail operation works:
![DetailSequenceDiagram](images/DetailSequenceDiagram.png)

### Note Feature (implemented by Kwok Yong)
The user can add a note to a specific contact based on an index.

Through `NoteCommandParser`, the index of the contact in the list and the field prefix `o/` is read. Keywords after the prefix are parsed and read into a `NoteDescripter`
object, where it is used construct a `NoteCommand` object.

Through `NoteCommand#execute()`, the `NoteDescriptor` is then used to create a `Person` object with the new note.
Through `model#setPerson()`, the `Person` object created then replaces the original `Person` object in the list.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between Logic and Model components after the API call `execute("note 1 o/This is a note!")`

![Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `note 1 o/This is a note!` Command](images/NoteSequenceDiagram.png)

Similar to the edit feature in AB3, by using NoteDescriptor object, we are able to keep the same level of abstraction. Moreover,
it ensures the immutability of `Person`.

      Expected: Shows the GUI with the default start page.

------
## **Planned Enhancements**
Given below are the fixes proposed to add in the near future.


1. #### Deal with values having leading whitespaces in data files
   1. The current implementation will not load the `addressbook.json` file in the data folder when there are leading whitespaces.
   2. We plan to trim the values of leading and trailing whitespaces before reading into `jsonAdaptedPerson.java`, so that even if there is leading whitespaces, the values can still be read. 
2. #### Deal with phone numbers having more than 15 digits long
   1. The current implementation will accept any phone number length more than 2, including numbers that are more than 15 digits long. However, the maximum phone number length in the world is 15.
   2. We plan to limit the phone number length so that it is 3 to 15 digits long, since all phone number with length more than 15 are technically invalid.
3. #### Expansion of `tag` feature
    1. Currently, the only way to modify tags is via the `edit` command which overwrites the entire tag list when executed.
    2. This can result in notable user inconvenience in at least one of two ways :
        1. If the user wants to append a tag, they need to overwrite the existing tag list with a new tag list that has all the old tags plus a new tag.
        2. If the user wants to edit one specific tag, they need to overwrite the existing tag list with a new tag list that has all the non-edited tags plus an edited tag.
    3. Proposed solution : Expand `edit` with new prefixes for tag editing.
        1. E.g. `at/` to add a tag.
        2. E.g. `et/` to mark a tag for editing, with whitespace-delimited before-after.
            1. I.e. `edit et/ before after` could change the tag `before` to the tag `after`.
        3. `dt/` could delete a tag.
4. #### Deal with text-wrapping and truncation in UI
   1. The current implementation of the personViewPanel truncates text subjective to the window size, making users unable to view extremely long text even with text wrapping enabled in the UI.
   2. Current implementation also restricts note field to 1000 characters.
   3. Proposed solution: To enable the personViewPanel to be scrollable, so when text is wrapped, the panel expands vertically so text is no longer truncated.
